This is my first post. That's exciting in itself, right?

Just so you know what to look out for, here are the styles I'll be using throughout this site:

# Header 1
For the biggest, most important stuff.

## Header 2
For big, and still relatively important stuff, like page titles.

### Header 3
For specific chunks of a page, like subtitles of a page.

#### Header 4
For individual items, like titles of a list of blog posts.

##### Header 5
For emphasis, or brief descriptions.

###### Header 6
Basically never used, but sometimes for meta-descriptions.

We can also do lists!

- Here's an item
- And here's another
- Finally–because all good things come in threes–here's a third

Numbered lists are also pretty fun for counting things.

1. Wow!
2. Really?
3. Well, yeah.

And within each line, you might see **bold** statements, or *italic* ones.

To link to less-cool site, I'll do [this](http://williamkrakow.dev).

This is [an example][id] reference-style link.

[id]: http://example.com "Optional Title"

And finally, some rarely-used stuff:

_single asterisks_

_single underscores_

**double asterisks**

**double underscores**

This paragraph has some `code` in it.
